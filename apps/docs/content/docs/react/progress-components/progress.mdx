import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';
import { TypeTable } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/type-table';

One of the great new features of **BProgress** version `1.1` is the ability to integrate one or more progress bars anywhere in your code.

The `Progress` component is optional, meaning you can use it to create one or more progress bars in your code. If you don't, the default progress bar will be created automatically.

<Callout type="warn" title="Warning">
  When using a custom component for the progress bar, the component will not be dynamically added or removed from the DOM. Instead, it will simply toggle between `display: block` and `display: none`.  
  This behavior may impact performance, especially if the component involves complex rendering or layout calculations.
</Callout>

## Progress

### Import

You can import the `Progress` component like this:

```tsx
import { Progress } from '@bprogress/...';
```

<Callout title="Note">
  Replace the `...` in the import with the library you're using. For example, if you use `@bprogress/next`, import by doing `from '@bprogress/next'`
</Callout>

<Callout type='warn' title="Warning">
  The `Progress` component must be used inside the `ProgressProvider` with the option `template` set to `null`.

  ```tsx
  <ProgressProvider options={{
    template: null,
  }}>
    <Progress />
  </ProgressProvider>
  ```
</Callout>

### Usage

You can use one or more progressive components anywhere in your code.

<Callout type='warn' title="Warning">
  The `Progress` component has a `display:none;` style by default, and this will change to `display:block;` for display. You won't be able to play with the component's display property. 
</Callout>

You can use with no children:

```tsx
<Progress />
```

This will automatically create a complete progress element like this:

```tsx
<Progress>
  <Bar>
    <Peg />
  </Bar>
  <Spinner>
    <SpinnerIcon />
  </Spinner>
</Progress>
```

You can also use any children you wish like this:

```tsx
<Progress>
  <Bar />
</Progress>
```

This can be a good solution if you want to customize your `Progress` component with TailwindCSS classes like this:

```tsx
<div className="fixed top-4 overflow-hidden inset-x-4 rounded-lg bg-neutral-100 h-10">
  <Progress>
    <Bar className="!absolute z-[9999] !bottom-0 !top-auto"></Bar>
    <Spinner className="!top-16">
      <SpinnerIcon />
    </Spinner>
  </Progress>
</div>
```

<Callout title="Note">
  Here we use `!` to set classes to `!important`, as we're using basic CSS. However, if you're using custom CSS or no CSS with the `disableStyle` property, you don't need to set the classes to `!important`. 
</Callout>

### Props

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| as | `React.ElementType` | `'div'` | The component to render the progress element |
| children | `React.ReactNode` | `undefinded` | The children of the progress element |
| ...rest | `React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<T>` | - | The rest of the props are passed to the progress element |

## Advanced Usage

To create absolute position progress bars inside elements that are not directly aligned with the screen edges, you'll need to set the `positionUsing` option to `width`.

```tsx
<ProgressProvider options={{
  template: null,
  positionUsing: 'width',
}}>
  <Progress />
</ProgressProvider>
```

<Callout title="Note">
  By default, `positionUsing` will give priority to `translate3d` (depending on browser compatibility), as this method leverages GPU acceleration, providing smoother animations and better performance, especially for complex or frequently updated UI elements. Using `translate3d` helps reduce layout recalculations and enhances rendering efficiency compared to other positioning methods.
