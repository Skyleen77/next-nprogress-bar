description: Use the `Bar` component

The `Bar` component must be used inside the `Progress` component.

## Import

```tsx
import { Bar } from '@bprogress/...';
```

<Callout title="Note">
  Replace the `...` in the import with the library you're using. For example, if you use `@bprogress/next`, import by doing `from '@bprogress/next'`
</Callout>

## Usage

The `Bar` component is used to create the progress bar element.

  <Peg />
</Bar>
```
