## New features

### `ProgressProvider`

The component `ProgressBar` has been replaced by `ProgressProvider`. This provider contains the `ProgressBar` component and some methods with the `useProgress` hook to control the progress bar.

```tsx
<ProgressProvider 
  height="4px"
  color="#fffd00"
  options={{ showSpinner: false }}
  shallowRouting
>
  {children}
</ProgressProvider>
```

[More information here](/docs/next/progress-provider)

### `useProgress`

The `useProgress` hook is used to manipulate the progress state.

```tsx
const { start, stop, inc, set, pause, resume, setOptions, getOptions } = useProgress();
```

[More information here](/docs/react/use-progress)

### Progress components

You can now add one or more progress bars anywhere in your code.

```tsx
<Progress />
// or
<Progress>
  <Bar>
    <Peg />
  </Bar>
  <Spinner>
    <SpinnerIcon />
  </Spinner>
</Progress>
```

<Callout type='warn' title="Warning">
  The `Progress` component must be used inside the `ProgressProvider` with the option `template` set to `null`.

  ```tsx
  <ProgressProvider options={{
    template: null,
  }}>
    <Progress />
  </ProgressProvider>
  ```
</Callout>

This, combined with the `disableStyle` property, allows you to make your progress using TailwindCSS only.

### `useRouter` (only for App directory)

A new `basePath` option has been added to the router.
This option is only useful if you use a `basePath` in your `next.config.mjs` file.

```tsx
const router = useRouter(undefined, { basePath: '/docs' });
```

You can also pass the options directly on the `useRouter` hook if you want to use the same options for all router actions.

```tsx
const router = useRouter({ basePath: '/docs' });
```

<Callout title="Note">
  By default, if you do not specify any options when calling a router method, the options defined during the initialization of the `useRouter` hook will be applied. However, if you provide specific options in the method call (`push`, `replace`, `back`, `refresh`), these will take precedence and override the default options set in the hook.
</Callout>

## Roadmap

The package is destined to evolve into the best progress bar solution.

We have defined a Roadmap to provide greater visibility on future developments. This will evolve over time.
